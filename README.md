Hello to whoever reads this! 
Welcome to the Extended_Connect_X Project, a custom connect four game that can be changed to your liking.
Whether you want to play with more than two players, a bigger or smaller board, or even an entirely different implmentation of the game, this is the connect "four" game for you :).

How to Run the GAME:
Simply locate the src file with the "Makefile" present. Change directory until you are in the src folder then type "make" into the command line and then "make run".
Afterwards follow the on screen instructions and you will be able to play the game!

I hope you enjoy this game! 

Side Note: There is a version of this project that allows for GUI compatability, I however have to some testing on this (To assure it works properly, it has been a sec since I last used it).
